The\\ntest set is there to judge the performance of the selected model.\\n\\n‘The estimated prediction error curves are shown in Figure 3.7. Many of\\nthe curves are very flat over large ranges near their minimum, Included\\nare estimated standard error bands for each estimated error rate, based on\\nthe ten error estimates computed by cross-validation. We have used the\\n“one-standard-error” rule—we pick the most parsimonious model within\\nfone standard error of the minimum (Section 7.10, page 244). Such a rule\\nacknowledges the fact that the tradeoff curve is estimated with error, and\\nhence takes a conservative approach.\\n\\nBest-subset selection chose to use the two predictors 1evol and 1weight.\\n‘The last two lines of the table give the average prediction error (and its\\nestimated standard error) over the test set.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n', '4 Shrinkage Methods', '\\n\\nBy retaining a subset of the predictors and discarding the rest, subset selee-\\ntion produces a model that is interpretable and has passibly lower predic-\\ntion error than the full model. However, because it is a diserete process—\\nvariables are either retained or discarded—it often exhibits high variance,\\nand so doesn’t reduce the prediction error of the full model.
